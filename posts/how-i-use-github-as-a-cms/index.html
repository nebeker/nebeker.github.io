Iâ€™ve used WordPress, in both its open source and hosted versions, and Iâ€™ve hand-crafted HTML and CSS when thatâ€™s what the project called for. I make no claims to know what the one-and-only blogging solution is, because I donâ€™t think that exists.</p><h2 id=my-stack><a class=anchor href=#my-stack title='Anchor for: My Stack.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.6d00947a8cc8365db632b6a6fe84ef2a.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> My Stack</h2><p>What Iâ€™m looking for is:</p><ul><li>Markdown source;</li><li>Static site generator;</li><li>Simple pipeline;</li><li>No-frills non-comercial hosting.</li></ul><p>I get that with a combination of Obsidian, VS Code, Hugo and GitHub Pages. I also want my own domain, but thatâ€™s not necessary for many cases, in particular FOSS projects, so I won&rsquo;t go into it here.</p><h3 id=writing-in-markdown><a class=anchor href=#writing-in-markdown title='Anchor for: Writing in Markdown.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.6d00947a8cc8365db632b6a6fe84ef2a.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Writing in Markdown</h3><p><a href=https://www.markdownguide.org>Markdown</a> is an open, simple, human-readable, plaintext markup language. Using simple syntax like number signs, asterisks and brackets, one can format documents in a very light way. The plaintext format also makes them portable.</p><p>This format is popular for technical documentation and in social media. It&rsquo;s supported by GitHub, GitLab, <a href=https://blog.nebeker.tech/posts/accessibledoctool/>Pandoc (which I&rsquo;ve used for a project before)</a>, Reddit, Discord, Lemmy, Matrix, etc. You&rsquo;re very likely to have used it, even if you didn&rsquo;t know it.</p><p>Since it&rsquo;s plaintext, any editor works, but I like either <a href=https://obsidian.md>Obsidian</a>, a full-featured and extendable note-taking app, or <a href=https://code.visualstudio.com>Visual Studio Code</a>, a code-focused text editor turned IDE. Using either of these tools, I can share my notes and post source files across devices.</p><h3 id=generating-a-website-with-hugo><a class=anchor href=#generating-a-website-with-hugo title='Anchor for: Generating a Website with Hugo.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.6d00947a8cc8365db632b6a6fe84ef2a.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Generating a Website with Hugo</h3><p><a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a> is so cool and trendy that it calls for a rocket emoji. Here: ðŸš€</p><p>Let&rsquo;s back up a bit. I&rsquo;m writing a blog, not an e-commerce site. I don&rsquo;t want comments, likes, votes, shopping carts, favorites, user accounts or anything like that. That makes this a static website - it only shows content as-is and doesn&rsquo;t expect or need user input. That means there&rsquo;s no need for a database or any backend logic to speak of. All I need is a set of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and maybe image files, so I use a static site generator.</p><p>Hugo is written in Go, which makes it cool, and it supports a broad array of themes, because it&rsquo;s trendy. By running it in the command line, I can create content files with basic front matter and then generate the website and run it in a local server.</p><p>Its Markdown rendering, configuration, extendability, and themes are both friendly and complex enough to create pleasing, beautiful, functional and accessible websites - including supporting my extra requirement for multilingual content.</p><h3 id=hosting-with-github-pages><a class=anchor href=#hosting-with-github-pages title='Anchor for: Hosting With GitHub Pages.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.6d00947a8cc8365db632b6a6fe84ef2a.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Hosting With GitHub Pages</h3><p>OK, let&rsquo;s get this show on the road.</p><pre tabindex=0><code class=language-go-bash-template data-lang=go-bash-template>git checkout -b cms

git commit -m &#34;First draft about GitHub.&#34;
git push</code></pre><p><em>Pushing the source for this post to a remote repository</em></p><p><a href=https://pages.github.com>GitHub Pages</a> is a service for hosting pages provided by GitHub. Sensible naming aside, for non-comercial uses and with a few technical limitations, GitHub will take the contents of a public repository and host that as a static website. It really is just about as simple as that. <a href=https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/>GitLab</a> and <a href=https://codeberg.page>Codeberg</a> will do the same for you, using equally simple naming. GitLab doesn&rsquo;t seem to have a friendly landing page for this and instead offers serious documentation, but that&rsquo;s neither here nor there - you&rsquo;re most likely going to chose the service where you already have your code, I happen to use GitHub more.</p><p>When I push my static site to <code>main</code>, it&rsquo;s almost instantly served by GitHub with the new content. By having it on there, I get portability, reliability, access to the source from different devices and from anywhere in the world and even options for collaboration, because that&rsquo;s really what Git is all about.</p><h2 id=the-cms-part><a class=anchor href=#the-cms-part title='Anchor for: The CMS Part.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.6d00947a8cc8365db632b6a6fe84ef2a.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> The CMS Part</h2><p>But I promised you a Content Management System, didn&rsquo;t I? A website, an app, something like that, not command line tools.</p><p>Well, here it is:</p><p><img loading=lazy src=/images/how-i-use-github-as-a-cms-ios-app.png alt="a screenshot of the previous paragraphs on the iOS GitHub app"></p><p><em>GitHub iOS app</em></p><p>And here:</p><p><img loading=lazy src=/images/how-i-use-github-as-a-cms-github-desktop.png alt="a screenshot of the diff of the previous paragraphs and the markup for these screenshots on GitHub.com on desktop"></p><p><em>GitHub website on desktop</em></p><p>Of course, app and web editing a CMS do not make. If publishing a new blog post requires access to command line tools to generate the static pages, and you need to pick up a laptop to make any minor edit, we&rsquo;ve proved nothing, right?</p><p>This is where the pipeline comes in. I have an aversion to reinventing wheels, so I went looking for what I needed and adapted that to my needs. The Hugo team has their own documentation, but since I&rsquo;m using GitHub&rsquo;s free service and don&rsquo;t want the source files to be public - just the generated static site - I found <a href=https://finisky.github.io/deployhugofromprivaterepo.en/>this post from Finisky Garden</a> very helpful. Notice the <code>.github.io</code> that suggests this is hosted on GitHub Pages.</p><p>With that as a starting point, here&rsquo;s my workflow:</p><ol><li>Create a new post Markdown file on whatever device I happen to be on;</li><li>Push that to a new branch of my private source repo;</li><li>At some point, generate the site locally, to check everything worked as I intended it to;</li><li>Continue writing and editing;</li><li>Translate the original English post into Portuguese;</li><li>Merge to <code>main</code>;</li><li>The pipeline generates the new version of the site and pushes it to the public repo;</li><li>Share my latest mildly interesting blog post with people;</li><li>Work through any necessary post-publication editing and push to <code>main</code> again to update.</li></ol><p>OK, I really can&rsquo;t compete with WordPress, but I like it.</p><h2 id=would-i-recommend-this><a class=anchor href=#would-i-recommend-this title='Anchor for: Would I Recommend This?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.6d00947a8cc8365db632b6a6fe84ef2a.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Would I Recommend This?</h2><p>This stack and workflow obviously doesn&rsquo;t fit all the criteria for a CMS. I haven&rsquo;t even discussed images, even though that&rsquo;s not a particularly hard topic to handle with Hugo. I think I&rsquo;ve made a good case for some of the advantages and I&rsquo;ve been very open about the main disadvantage: if you want something dynamic, this is not what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p><p>Perhaps the most important question is &ldquo;is this setup easy to use for most people?&rdquo; No, of course not. As a software developer, I can extoll the superiority of plaintext and Git all day long, but What You See Is What You Get is popular for a reason. That being said, if all you need to do is make occasional changes to a simple website, most lay people will be able to learn the basics of GitHub. If the infrastructure is there, it really will feel a lot like WordPress.</p><p>This approach works for me, because I find the technical process fun. Why else would I write a post about it? If this is what &ldquo;fun&rdquo; means to you, I hope coming along for the ride was pleasant. Regardless, go have some fun.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=/images/how-i-use-github-as-a-cms-pull-request.jpg alt="screenshot of pull request for this post"></p><p><em>Merging this post to publish it</em></p></article></main></div><footer><p>Also available in: <a rel=alternate hreflang=pt href=/pt/posts/how-i-use-github-as-a-cms/>PortuguÃªs</a>.</p><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.6d00947a8cc8365db632b6a6fe84ef2a.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#f7cf3b title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#225670><option value=#f7cf3b></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
