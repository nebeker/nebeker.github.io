<a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/151820488@N08/53917183304/><em>In touch (at Flickr)</em></a></p><p>24C, mostly sunny, light wind on an August afternoon. In the Porto city center, the Serralves Foundation park offers a natural world enclave. By bringing nature into the built environment, it offers an usual sensory experience: the Treetop Walk.</p><h2 id=what-is-serralves><a class=anchor href=#what-is-serralves title='Anchor for: What is Serralves?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.6d00947a8cc8365db632b6a6fe84ef2a.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> What is Serralves?</h2><p><a href=https://www.serralves.pt/en/institucional-serralves/fundacao-apresentacao/>The Serralves Foundation</a> seeks to share culture and art with a broad audience, and operates a contemporary art museum, a surrounding park and various other assets. It&rsquo;s located in Porto, Portugal, near the city center.</p><p>An interesting element of the Foundation&rsquo;s outreach to a diverse audience is their long-standing <a href=https://www.serralves.pt/en/visitar-serralves/>free entry program on the first Sunday of every month</a>. I have very fond memories of family outings taking advantage of this option.</p><p>Reflecting this mindset, they also made a number of design choices and offer a variety of <a href=https://www.serralves.pt/en/institucional-serralves/acessibilidades/>accessibility options</a> to disabled visitors.</p><h2 id=whats-a-treetop-walk-and-how-inclusive-is-it><a class=anchor href=#whats-a-treetop-walk-and-how-inclusive-is-it title='Anchor for: What&rsquo;s a Treetop Walk and How Inclusive is it?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.6d00947a8cc8365db632b6a6fe84ef2a.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> What&rsquo;s a Treetop Walk and How Inclusive is it?</h2><p>The <a href=https://www.serralves.pt/en/institucional-serralves/5.8.-ok_-parque---treetop-walk/>Treetop Walk</a> is a walkway built at the tree canopy level to provide a different experience to Serralves&rsquo; various audiences.
Again, the Foundation&rsquo;s audience includes disabled people, so physical and sensory access needs should be considered here.</p><h3 id=physical-access><a class=anchor href=#physical-access title='Anchor for: Physical Access.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.6d00947a8cc8365db632b6a6fe84ef2a.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Physical Access</h3><p>This comprises the surface, amount of space and clearance, visibility considerations, and even rules for the use of the built environment.</p><p>I consulted with a friend who&rsquo;s a wheelchair user on this topic. She turned me on to that last point when I asked about clearance for a wheelchair user to cross paths with a person walking in the opposite direction. My friend estimated that that would be reasonably comfortable, but that two wheelchair users wouldn&rsquo;t be able to roll past each other. That&rsquo;s where the rules come in: as indicated in the map of the walkway, there is a set direction of travel. People shouldn&rsquo;t be going in opposite directions at all. I hadn&rsquo;t even noticed this, but maybe that&rsquo;s because I wasn&rsquo;t looking for it.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53917277220_09949588a1_k_d.jpg alt="Information panel on left side of entrance, in Portuguese and English as well as pictograms, including path distance (245m), map, entrance and exit, usage instructions (such as no smoking), caution notices (such as head-height hazards) and wheelchair accessibility symbol.">
<a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/151820488@N08/53917277220/in/datetaken-public/><em>Treetop Walk entrance III (at Flickr)</em></a></p><p>This goes to show 1) they did a good job here, and 2) we don&rsquo;t know what we don&rsquo;t know, and that&rsquo;s why we need to learn and pay attention to lived experience.</p><p>As for the walking or rolling surface, it&rsquo;s made of flat and nicely fitted wood boards with gently angled metal interfaces with the gravel paths that cover most of the park. Comfortable for different types of shoe ware, for wheels, for paws, and for mobility canes - support canes get good purchase, white canes get good feedback.</p><p>The fences and handrails are angled outward, allowing for extra visibility opportunities, looking downward. There are also handrails at two separate heights, allowing for comfortable use by people of and at different heights, including children. The mesh size is tight enough to reduce the risk of limbs and objects getting caught, and the fence itself is dark enough to reduce glare and improve visibility.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53916831786_dea99a611c_k_d.jpg alt="Point of view while following the path. The pavement is made of wood boards with no gaps. The fences on either side have handrails are two different heights and are angled. Some tree branches share the same space as visitors, posing head-height hazards.">
<a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/151820488@N08/53916831786/in/datetaken-public/><em>Walking along the treetops (at Flickr)</em></a></p><p>There is one concern here that&rsquo;s not so easy to manage, but is indicated at the entrance: some tree branches will be a hazard at head-height. Blind and visually impaired visitors may want to be mindful and use an <a href=https://www.keystoneblind.org/everyday-protective-techniques/>upper protective technique</a>, or wear a hat - they add 2 to damage resistance form overhanging objects and 3 to charisma.</p><h3 id=sensory-experiences><a class=anchor href=#sensory-experiences title='Anchor for: Sensory Experiences.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.6d00947a8cc8365db632b6a6fe84ef2a.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Sensory Experiences</h3><p>The previous section covered an important aspect of the sensory experience: there is good downward visibility. At the same time, the very nature of the Treetop Walk makes for unrivaled visibility into the treetops themselves. Humans rarely get this kind of access.</p><p>Humans certainly don&rsquo;t get this kind of <em>hands-on</em> access to treetops. Do you want to learn about the different kinds of leaves from the tree species at the park? Touch them.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53916831731_8d7963bccd_k_d.jpg alt="Scale-like leaves hang in the sun over a wooden handrail.

Sounds and scents may travel longer distances than touch, but the perspective here is still different. Particularly for smell, it&rsquo;s easier to pick apart what you get from each tree, without having it blend in with all the others. By being this close, you get access to the oils on certain leaves, what they feel like and what they smell like.</p><h3 id=connection-with-the-rest-of-the-park><a class=anchor href=#connection-with-the-rest-of-the-park title='Anchor for: Connection With The Rest of the Park.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.6d00947a8cc8365db632b6a6fe84ef2a.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Connection With The Rest of the Park</h3><p>The height of the Treetop Walk also offers a unique perspective on other parts of the park. On my visit, I was able to photograph an installation by Yayoi Kusama made from hundreds of floating aluminum spheres.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53915942927_5dcccfee7f_k_d.jpg alt="View through the fence of the Treetop Walk, showing a variety of trees, as well as an array of aluminum spheres on the surface of a body of water below.">

From price, physical accessibility, to the rare sensory experiences, I believe the Serralves Foundation&rsquo;s goals are met. The Treetop Walk is open to a broad and diverse community and enables education - formal and informal. It further connects the city to nature and to art in novel ways.</p><p>Some design decisions that went into this project may seem clear in retrospect, but they surely took careful analysis and consideration. As a whole, they help connect people to their community. Diversity and inclusion beget connection and shared experiences, and projects like this provide the conditions for that.</p><p>If you&rsquo;d like to connect with me after reading this, I&rsquo;m very easy to find online. The way I see the world is also easy to find, by following the links on this post to my Flickr photo stream. If you have thoughts about this topic you&rsquo;d like to share, please do reach out. Where do you go in your area to get experiences like this? Are those spaces accessible and inclusive? Did I miss something? If so, I&rsquo;d love to learn more from your experience.</p></article></main></div><footer><p>Also available in: <a rel=alternate hreflang=pt href=/pt/posts/an-inclusive-city-nature-experience/>Português</a>.</p><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.6d00947a8cc8365db632b6a6fe84ef2a.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#f7cf3b title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#225670><option value=#f7cf3b></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
